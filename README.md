## Francis
Current:
- Implementing proper mirror logic for game start, i.e. mana displays, card distribution

TODO:
- Mirror logic when in play
- Convert end turn button to authority of person being in turn
- Card playing logic properly reflected
- Card in hand display (tap to zoom, by default shrunk fanned out visual)
- Card positions (ensure boards are mirrored + preview of card placement by player)


## Max
Current:

TODO:
- Look to store user card decks (slack me when you get a chance, but would look at cardStatsSO, deck field in Player.cs to see how cards are brought in)
- Deck building/card collection scene (separate scene to make parallel work easier), since syncing would just be how the card are initialized
