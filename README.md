To test the game
1. Open 3 clients through ParrellSync 
2. 1 client as server only, other 2 as client

## Francis
Current:
- Add support to different card types (spells and weapons)
- Support on play, on death effects

TODO:
- Convert end turn button to authority of person being in turn


## Max
Current:

TODO:
- Look to store user card decks (slack me when you get a chance, but would look at cardStatsSO, deck field in Player.cs to see how cards are brought in)
- Deck building/card collection scene (separate scene to make parallel work easier), since syncing would just be how the card are initialized


## Future Goals
- Animations (start turn prompt, attack animation)
- Set limit on mana
- Draw card per turn
- Match making
- Pack openings (start looking at crypto integration)
- Play with friends
- Elo/ranked
