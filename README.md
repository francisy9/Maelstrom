## Francis
Current:
- Change enemy hand to fanned visual

TODO:
- Convert end turn button to authority of person being in turn
- Convert onplay, ondeath etc. mechanics to cardStats type? (figure out design)


## Max
Current:

TODO:
- Look to store user card decks (slack me when you get a chance, but would look at cardStatsSO, deck field in Player.cs to see how cards are brought in)
- Deck building/card collection scene (separate scene to make parallel work easier), since syncing would just be how the card are initialized
